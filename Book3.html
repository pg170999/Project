Review<br>
I liked this book because it makes an honest attempt to look at things from women's perspective. It is also different in that it describes an atypical Indian girl , and I can almost understand where the characters come from. It does not end in an unexpected way, but yet it ends in a good way. I really enjoyed reading this book. I appreciate that it talks about self respect despite our cultural and ethnic backgrounds. --By A Customer on October 15, 2016<br>

While Chetan Bhagat is so known for clear and simple articulation, with hilarious analogies, he has taken this up a notch from his standard. The inner feelings of a woman - uncoated, plain and not blanched by attribution errors, as the inner 'mini-me' of the main character is Extremely accurate. --By Padma Venkatrangan on October 5, 2016<br>

Good simple writing that i love, enjoyed the feminism take and could identify with so much! Glad it didn't have a filmy ending lol --By A&P on October 18, 2016<br>
