Geronimo Stilton arrives at work one fine morning to find the office in a complete uproar. The minute Geronimo sets his paw in the office, he realises this is not going to be a good day. His staff is complaining about things and everything is in disorder. Worst of all, he has a pimple on his snout. When he heads home after work, he is struck by a lightening and the electricity goes off. He has to find his way to his attic in pitch dark. After several mishaps like stepping on a roller skate and stepping onto a rake, he discovers a magical golden staircase there. He steps into the Kingdom of Fantasy. He is helped by Scribblehopper, a frog, who acts as his guide. His mission is to save the Queen of Fairies.<br>
