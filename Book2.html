Review
Electric . . . Filled with staccato bursts of humor and tragedy (Jodi Picoult)

A novel of life and death and the people caught in between, The Fault in Our Stars is John Green at his best. You laugh, you cry, and then you come back for more (Markus Zusak, author of The Book Thief)

Damn near genius . . . Simply devastating . . . Fearless in the face of powerful, uncomplicated, unironized emotion (TIME)

Funny . . . Poignant . . . Luminous (Entertainment Weekly)<br>
